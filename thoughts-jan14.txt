TODAY WAS A VERY GOOD DAY
=========================

some really important features for typewriter, roughly in this order:

- export as PDF
- export as .txt
- automatic return carriage noise when it drops a line
  because you typed too far
- janky moving up of text, and it moving side to side
- having to x out characters to delete them 
  fuck canvas, having text is important
- make the tab key work!
- consider cursor-less text input without text selection in 
  the edit mode to make it more constrained


bugs:
- no sound for colon, semi colon, other keys (maybe black list keys instead? idk
- pasting can keep formatting
- 

whatever ideas:
- make links clickable
- save to account, private or public
